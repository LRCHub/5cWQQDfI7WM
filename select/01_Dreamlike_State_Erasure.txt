(A. Bell / V. Clarke)

I can see clearly now, as the crazy haste of night
Turns to morning.
I lie in a dreamlike state,
And wonder if the fear will go away.
I know that you're here,
In the space that surrounds me.
And you make me feel like a kid in a movie,
I know that you love me.

Like the sound of the sea
Rush in to shore,
The air that I breathe,
Fills me with your love.

I've wasted a thousand nights
For comfort in the arms of a stranger.
I thought it would lead me on to
Bigger, brighter things.
But you know that I'm wrong,
I doesn't exist.
And you make me feel like a kid in a movie,
I know that you love me.

Like the sound of the sea
Rush in to shore,
The air that I breathe,
Fills me with your love.
Like the clouds in the sky,
The rain falling down,
Washes my feet,
Pulls me to the ground.
I'm begging you please
Never to leave me.
I know you believe,
You know what I've said and done.
Like the sound of the sea
Rushes to shore,
The air that I breathe,
Fills me with your love.
Like the clouds in the sky,
The rain falling down,
Washes my feet,
Pulls me to the ground.
I'm begging you please
Never to leave me.
I know you believe,
You know what I've said and done.
